Data scientists are tasked with the analysis and interpretation of data sets, finding valuable insights to facilitate informed decision-making. They acquire data from multiple sources, and undertake preprocessing and cleansing processes. Using statistical methods and visualization techniques, they explore and comprehend the underlying patterns within the data. Data scientists construct and train machine learning models. To effectively communicate their findings, they tailor presentations to the technical proficiency of their audience, employing various techniques to ensure clarity and comprehension.\n",
